The Automatic Speed and Accident Avoidance System is designed to enhance vehicular safety by preventing over-speeding and reducing accidents. This project uses embedded systems and sensor technology to monitor and control vehicle speed, ensuring compliance with speed limits and providing real-time alerts to drivers in potential accident scenarios.
Key Features
Speed Monitoring: Continuously monitors vehicle speed using sensors and compares it with permissible limits.
Speed Control: Automatically adjusts vehicle speed to prevent over-speeding.
Obstacle Detection: Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and alert the driver.
Accident Avoidance: Implements algorithms for corrective actions like braking or steering to avoid collisions.
User Interface: Provides real-time monitoring and control with visual and auditory alerts.
Technologies Used
Embedded Systems: Microcontroller-based system for real-time monitoring and control.
Sensors: Ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection, speed sensors for monitoring speed.
Actuators: Mechanisms for automatic speed adjustment and braking.
Programming Languages: C/C++ for microcontroller programming, embedded C for sensor integration.
Communication Protocols: I2C, SPI for sensor and actuator communication.
